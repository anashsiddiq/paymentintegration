# paymentintegration

1. Description

This is a Seamless Payment Integration Demo that simulates UPI-based payments. It allows a user to:

Enter an amount and invoice ID for a payment.

Create a transaction (generate a token).

Fetch UPI payment details:

UPI link

QR code (to scan and pay)

Check transaction status (Pending / Completed / Failed).

Key points:

The demo uses mock mode to simulate real payments without actually processing money.

The QR code is generated using a public QR API (https://api.qrserver.com) and encoded in Base64.

The demo logs all actions and shows feedback messages for a clear user experience.

Fully responsive design using Bootstrap 5, works on desktop and mobile.

2. How to Set It Up / Create It
Step 1: Create Project Folder

Create a folder named PaymentIntegration in your web server (e.g., htdocs in XAMPP or www in WAMP).

Step 2: Create Files

Inside the folder, create these 3 files:

index.php – contains frontend (HTML + JS + CSS)

api.php – handles AJAX requests from frontend

SeamlessClient.php – PHP class that communicates with payment API or mock mode

Paste the respective code I gave you into these files.

Step 3: Start Local Server

If using XAMPP/WAMP:

Start Apache.

Open browser and go to:
http://localhost/PaymentIntegration/index.php

3. How Functionality Works (Step by Step)
Step A: Create Transaction

Enter Amount (INR) and Invoice ID.

Click Pay / Create Transaction.

The frontend sends an AJAX request to api.php with action=create_transaction.

The backend (SeamlessClient) returns a token representing this transaction.

UI displays the token and amount.

Step B: Fetch Deposit Details

After transaction is created, the system automatically calls get_deposit:

Generates a UPI link.

Generates a QR code for scanning with a UPI app.

UI shows QR code and copy/open buttons.

Step C: Check Status

Click Check Status button to see if payment is completed.

Backend returns transaction_status (Pending by default in mock mode).

UI updates badge:

Pending → yellow

Completed → green

Failed / Other → red

Logs show all responses for debugging.

Step D: Copy / Open UPI Link

Click copy to copy UPI link to clipboard.

Click open to open UPI link in a new tab (launches UPI app on mobile if supported).

4. How to Use It

Open the demo in your browser.

Enter Amount you want to pay (e.g., 10 INR).

Enter an Invoice ID (auto-generated using time()).

Ensure Mock Mode checkbox is checked (for testing without real payment).

Click Pay / Create Transaction:

Token is generated.

Deposit details are fetched (QR + UPI link).

Scan the QR code using a UPI app or click Open UPI.

Click Check Status to refresh transaction status.

See logs for debugging or tracking the flow.

5. Important Notes

In mock mode, transactions do not process real payments. It is only for testing.

If you want real payment integration, replace the mock mode with actual API keys and endpoints.

All communication between frontend and backend is done via AJAX JSON requests.

QR code is dynamically generated using a public API and embedded as Base64 for display.

Quick Tips

Always check console and logs if QR or UPI link doesn’t appear.

You can adjust the default amount in index.php input field.

Mock mode allows you to simulate transactions quickly without real money.

For real payment integration:

Replace dummy create_key and validate_key with your merchant keys.

Change API URLs in SeamlessClient.php to the production endpoints.
